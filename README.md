# A Modular Approach for the Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Protocol under Churn

Blockchain is an emerging technology that gained a lot of attention in the last years. Many different
consensus protocols have been proposed to improve both the scalability and the resilience of existing
blockchain. However, most of these solutions have been defined for rather static settings, where the
system does not change or changes very slowly, mainly due to failures. Real networks might be
subject to a progressive refreshment of the peers participating in the system, known as churn.
Every blockchain protocol can be seen as the composition of three main distributed building blocks:
a) overlay management protocol, b) communication layer, c) agreement primitive.
In this work is proposed a modular approach for analyzing and comparing different consensus
protocols used in blockchain under churn conditions. The results from the simulations carried
out with the OMNeT++ discrete-event simulation framework help to clarify how these distributed
blocks are related and how different churning models impact the blockchain.
